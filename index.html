                            I transitioned to web development in 2019 after years of work at a non-profit in the field of organ transplantion.  While I enjoyed positively impacting lives with a great team of bright and passionate individuals,  I always felt that I wanted to acquire more hard skills.  I always admired the work of the developers responsible for our company's various websites and wondered if I could ever make the transition to do the type of creative work they do.  In the summer of 2019, I got the opportunity to revisit the idea of attending the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp. I looked into the program in 2018, but now I had the opportunity to take the plunge into web development.
